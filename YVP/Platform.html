          1. Promote Responsibility: Encourage students to take ownership of
          their actions and follow rules. Reward students for being responsible,
          with things like “Student of the Month.”
        </p>

        <p>
          2. Support School Pride and Traditions: Host events that celebrate
          school history and spirit. Teach respect for Canadian traditions and
          history to help students understand their roots.
        </p>

        <p>
          3. Focus on Academics and Job Preparation: Offer programs for students
          interested in trades or hands-on careers. Provide extra help and
          materials for students aiming to do well in core subjects.
        </p>

        <p>
          4. Use School Funds Wisely: Spend money on resources that help
          students the most, like books, computers, and classroom tools. Focus
          on cost-effective solutions to make sure funds go to things that
          benefit as many students as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          5. Teach Civic Responsibility: Encourage clubs that teach about civic
          duties, like student government. Offer workshops on real-life skills,
          like budgeting and voting, to prepare students for the future.
