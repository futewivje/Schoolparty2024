          1. After-School Clubs for All Interests: Offer clubs that match
          student interests, like art, cooking, coding, or debate, so everyone
          has something they enjoy. Allow students to create new clubs with
          teacher support if they have a unique idea.
        </p>

        <p>
          2.Volunteer Days: Organize days where students can volunteer, like
          cleaning up the school grounds or helping out at local charities.
          Reward volunteers with small prizes or certificates, encouraging
          community involvement.
        </p>

        <p>
          3. Themed Spirit Weeks: Host a week with daily themes, like “Retro
          Day” or “Sports Day,” where students can dress up and show their
          school spirit. Add small competitions between grades, with a prize for
          the most spirited class.
