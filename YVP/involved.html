          Your voice and involvement matter because they shape our school
          community. When you speak up, join activities, or participate in
          events, you bring fresh ideas and make a real difference. Every
          student’s perspective adds value, helping us create a school that
          reflects everyone’s needs and interests. By getting involved, you’re
          not just building school spirit, you’re building a better environment
          for all of us. Let’s work together to make sure our school is a place
          where every voice is heard and every student feels they belong.
