        <p>
          1. Improve Extracurricular Activities: Focus on sports and clubs that
          build teamwork, responsibility, and leadership. Support academic clubs
          and competitions to boost student success. Let students lead
          activities, so they learn more about responsibility and teamwork.
        </p>

        <p>
          2. Build a Strong School Culture: Promote respect, responsibility, and
          discipline in school. Celebrate school traditions and events to create
          a sense of pride. Teach about Canadian history and rights to inspire
          active, responsible citizens.
        </p>

        <p>
          3. Use Resources Wisely:Spend on things that benefit most students,
          like books and technology. Make sure funds go to programs and
          activities that improve learning. Keep a close eye on the budget to
          get the best value for students.
        </p>

        <p>
          4. Learning and Achievement: Establish high academic goals for
          students and help them reach those targets. Provide tutoring and
          mentoring, using support from older students or alumni. Focus on
          essential subjects like history, math, and science to build a strong
          education.
        </p>

        <p>
          5. Encourage Parent and Community Involvement: Partner with local
          businesses (perhaps) for student internships and job experience. Host
          family-friendly events to get parents involved. Listen to parentsâ€™
          feedback to make sure school decisions reflect community needs.
