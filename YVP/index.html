              We believe in responsible budgeting to ensure our school has the

              essential programs, such as mental health support and
              extracurricular activities, while ensuring transparency in how
              funds are allocated. We will work to secure grants and
              sponsorships to enhance our facilities and activities without
              placing an extra burden on students or families. Together, we can
              create a budget that reflects our commitment to a thriving and
              supportive school environment!
