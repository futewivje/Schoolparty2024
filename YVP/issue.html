          1. Issue: Low Student Participation in Activities Solution: Ask
          students what clubs or sports they want. Promote these activities with
          help from student leaders, and offer small rewards, like extra credit,
          for joining.
        </p>

        <p>
          2. Issue: Problems with Discipline and Respect Solution: Make a clear
          set of rules for behavior and reward students for following them. Use
          older students as mentors to guide younger ones and build a respectful
          school culture.
        </p>

        <p>
          3. Issue: Limited Budget for New Programs Solution: Focus on spending
          money where it will help the most, like buying new books or
          technology. Consider fundraising or partnering with local businesses
          for support.
        </p>

        <p>
          4. Issue: Low Engagement in School Traditions Solution: Make events
          more exciting by involving students in planning. Add fun themes or
          competitions to traditions to make them feel fresh and enjoyable.
        </p>

        <p>
          5. Issue: Disagreement from Parents or Community Members Solution:
          Hold regular meetings to hear parents' opinions and address any
          concerns. Be open about decisions and explain how they help students.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Issue: Balancing Academics with Extracurriculars Solution: Offer
          flexible schedules for students involved in both activities. Provide
          extra help for those balancing schoolwork and clubs, and teach time
          management skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          7. Issue: Getting Students Interested in Core Subjects Solution: Make
          core subjects fun by connecting them to real life. Host events like
          math contests or science fairs to engage students and show them the
          value of these subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Issue: Lack of Extra Study Materials for Tests and Advanced
          Subjects Solution: Create a resource center where students can find
          extra materials for tests, like the SSAT, and for higher-level
          subjects. Organize study groups or tutoring sessions led by teachers
          or older students to help those preparing for these challenges.
